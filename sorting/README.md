# Sorting Algorithms

Sorting is one of the fundamental concepts in computer science. It involves arranging data in a specific order ‚Äî typically **ascending** or **descending** ‚Äî to make it easier to search, analyze, and process.

This guide introduces the concept of sorting and presents several widely used **sorting algorithms**, each with unique characteristics in terms of speed, memory usage, and use cases.

## üìå What is Sorting?

**Sorting** refers to the process of rearranging elements in a collection (like an array or list) based on a comparison operator (e.g., `<`, `>`). The goal is to organize the data so that:
- Searching becomes faster.
- Data can be processed more efficiently.
- Patterns become easier to identify.

#### For example:
```
Input: [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]

Sorted: [11, 12, 22, 25, 34, 64, 90] ‚Üí Ascending Order
```

## üîç Brief Description of Each Algorithm

### 1. [**Bubble Sort**](/sorting/bubble-sort/README.md)
Repeatedly compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. Simple but inefficient for large lists.

### 2. [**Selection Sort**](/sorting/selection-sort/README.md)
Finds the smallest element and places it at the beginning. Repeats this process for the remaining unsorted portion.

### 3. [**Insertion Sort**](/sorting/insertion-sort/README.md)
Builds the final sorted array one item at a time by inserting each new element into its correct position. Very efficient for small or nearly sorted arrays.

### 4. [**Merge Sort**](/sorting/merge-sort/README.md)
Uses **divide-and-conquer**: splits the list in half, recursively sorts both halves, then merges them back together. Always has O(n log n) time, making it predictable and stable.

### 5. [**Quick Sort**](/sorting/quick-sort/README.md)
Picks a "pivot" element, partitions the array around it, and recursively sorts the sub-arrays. Extremely fast in practice due to cache efficiency and low overhead.

### 6. [**Heap Sort**](/sorting/heap-sort/README.md)
Converts the array into a max heap and repeatedly extracts the maximum element. Guarantees O(n log n) performance regardless of input distribution.

### 7. [**Counting Sort**](/sorting/counting-sort/README.md)
Counts occurrences of each value and reconstructs the sorted list using those counts. Not comparison-based ‚Äî only works for integer-like data within a known range.

### 8. [**Radix Sort**](/sorting/radix-sort/README.md)
Sorts numbers digit by digit from least significant to most significant using counting sort as a subroutine. Runs in linear time for fixed-size integers.

### 9. [**Shell Sort**](/sorting/shell-sort/README.md)
An optimized version of insertion sort that compares elements separated by a gap. The gap decreases over time, allowing far-away elements to move quickly toward their correct positions. Performs well in real-world scenarios despite theoretical worst-case performance.

### 10. [**Bucket Sort**](/sorting/bucket-sort/README.md)
Distributes elements into a number of "buckets". Each bucket is then sorted individually (often with another algorithm like insertion sort). Most effective when input is uniformly distributed across a range.

### 11. [**Cycle Sort**](/sorting/cycle-sort/README.md)  
Minimizes the number of writes by placing each element in its correct position in cycles. Ideal when write operations are expensive (e.g., flash memory).

### 12. [**Comb Sort**](/sorting/comb-sort/README.md)  
Improves Bubble Sort by comparing elements with a large gap that shrinks over time. More efficient than Bubble Sort in practice.

### 13. [**Pigeonhole Sort**](/sorting/pigeonhole-sort/README.md)  
Similar to Counting Sort but stores actual elements (not just counts) in "pigeonholes". Best when range `k` is close to `n`.

### 14. [**Tim Sort**](/sorting/tim-sort/README.md)  
A hybrid stable sorting algorithm (Merge + Insertion) that performs well on real-world data. Used in **Python's `sorted()`** and **Java's `Arrays.sort()`**.

### 15. [**Intro Sort**](/sorting/intro-sort/README.md)  
A hybrid algorithm (Quick + Heap + Insertion) that starts with Quick Sort, switches to Heap Sort if recursion depth is too high, and uses Insertion Sort for small arrays. Used in **C++ `std::sort()`**.
