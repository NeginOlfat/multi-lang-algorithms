# üîç Search Algorithms

Search algorithms are essential tools for locating data efficiently within data structures such as arrays, lists, trees, graphs, and strings. This repository provides clean, well-documented implementations of key search algorithms with explanations and time/space complexity analysis.



## üß© Algorithms Covered

### üî¢ Array-Based Search Algorithms
1. [**Linear Search**](/search/array-based-search/linear-search/README.md): Scans each element one by one until the target is found or the end is reached.
2. [**Binary Search**](/search/array-based-search/binary-search/README.md): Repeatedly divides a sorted array in half to locate the target.
3. [**Jump Search**](/search/array-based-search/jump-search/README.md): Jumps ahead by fixed steps and then performs linear search in the identified block (on sorted arrays).
4. [**Interpolation Search**](/search/array-based-search/interpolation-search/README.md): Estimates the position of the target based on value distribution (best for uniformly distributed data).
5. [**Exponential Search**](/search/array-based-search/exponential-search/README.md): Finds the range where the element may exist using powers of two, then applies binary search.
6. [**Ternary Search**](/search/array-based-search/ternary-search/README.md): Divides a sorted unimodal array into three parts to find min/max or a target value.
7. **Fibonacci Search**: Similar to binary search but uses Fibonacci numbers to split the array.
8. **Sentinel Search**: A variation of linear search that places a sentinel at the end to avoid boundary checks.
9. **Self-Organizing Search**: Adjusts the list (e.g., move-to-front) after each access based on frequency.
10. **Binary Search on Answer**: Applies binary search over a range of possible answers (common in optimization problems).

### üå≥ Tree Search Algorithms
1. **Inorder Traversal (DFS)**: Visits left subtree, root, then right subtree (for binary trees). 
2. **Preorder Traversal (DFS)**: Visits root, then left and right subtrees recursively. 
3. **Postorder Traversal (DFS)**: Visits left and right subtrees, then the root node. 
4. **Level-Order Traversal (BFS)**: Visits nodes level by level from top to bottom using a queue. 
5. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: Explores as deep as possible down each branch before backtracking. 
6. **Iterative Deepening DFS (IDDFS)**: Performs DFS with increasing depth limits to combine advantages of BFS and DFS. 

---

### üîó Graph Search Algorithms
1. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Explores all neighbors at current depth before moving deeper (finds shortest path in unweighted graphs). 
2. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: Explores as deep as possible in a branch before backtracking (useful for cycle detection, connectivity).
3. **Dijkstra‚Äôs Algorithm**: Finds shortest paths from a source in weighted graphs with non-negative edge weights.
4. **A* Search**: Uses heuristics to guide pathfinding efficiently in weighted graphs (optimal if heuristic is admissible).
5. **Bellman-Ford Algorithm**: Computes shortest paths even with negative weights; detects negative cycles.
6. **Floyd-Warshall Algorithm**: Computes shortest paths between all pairs of vertices.
7. **Prim‚Äôs Algorithm**: Builds a minimum spanning tree by greedily adding the least-cost edge.
8. **Kruskal‚Äôs Algorithm**: Builds a minimum spanning tree by adding smallest edges while avoiding cycles.
9. **Topological Sort**: Orders nodes in a directed acyclic graph (DAG) based on dependencies.
10. **Tarjan‚Äôs Algorithm**: Finds strongly connected components in a directed graph using DFS.
11. **Kosaraju‚Äôs Algorithm**: Another method for finding strongly connected components (uses two DFS passes).
12. **Bidirectional Search**: Simultaneously searches forward from start and backward from goal, meeting in the middle.
