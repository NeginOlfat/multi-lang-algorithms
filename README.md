# Programming Algorithms Repository

This repository contains **implementations of programming algorithms** across multiple languages, designed for learning, reference, and interview preparation. Each algorithm is explained clearly and implemented consistently in several programming languages.

This repository aims to provide solutions to common programming challenges and demonstrate algorithmic concepts across different languages. Each language has its own folder containing relevant implementations and explanations.

## 📦 Languages Supported

Each algorithm is implemented in the following languages:

- 🐍 **Python**
- 🔵 **C#**
- 🟨 **JavaScript**
- 💜 **C++**
- ☕ **Java**
