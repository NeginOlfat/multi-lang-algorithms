## ℹ️ What is a Factorial?

A **factorial** is a mathematical function that multiplies a given number by every whole number less than or equal to it, down to 1.

<br />

#### 📐 Definition:

\[
n! = n × (n-1) × (n-2) × ... × 1
\]

<br />
By definition:

\[
0! = 1
\]

<br />

#### 🔢 Example:

\[
5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120
\]

<br />
